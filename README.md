# IOT_Assignment_1
By: Jordan Gonen & Justin Friedman 

Our goal was to build a IoT Garage Door User Interface that a) solved user painpoints and b)supported our IoT system. 

## Flow: 
User creates account and signs in to the "Garage Door Company" Dashboard. From there, they can add garages, and toggle settings for status and basic controls (like open/closing) as well as more advanced features like auto-close and text notifications. 

Our bonus feature aimed to solve a user painpoint of having to click "open the garage door" every time they were coming home. Thus, we built a UI for using GPS detection to "Auto Open" Garage when you are within x amount of yards of the system. This really smooths out the experience of coming home so you do not have to wait for your garage door to open. 

We wrote all of the code on our own, the only thing "borrowed" is the font awesome icons which are free to use from the creator. The link to the stylesheet can be found in the head of all html files.
